      <p>Crystal Factions is a card battle game for 1-4 players with pre-made decks to get you right into the action. You play as one of the Factions of space-faring civilizations who rely on energy crystals as a power source and a currency. The battle takes place on a mineral rich planet where you and you opponents all try and mine the most crystals or just destory your enemies and claim the planet for yourselves.</p>

<p>Gameplay revoles around deploying cards to mine crystals, level up your attack, or research advanced technology. Each card has a crystal cost and a tech requirement, so investing in mining and technology is key to being able to play your more powerful cards. Donâ€™t neglect attack though, your base can only sustain so much damage before you are destroyed and out of the game.</p>
