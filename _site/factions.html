      <h3 id="megalaxian-mining-consortium">Megalaxian Mining Consortium</h3>

<p>The mining consortium is a large company of money hungry capitalists who scour the galaxy for crystal rich planets to mine. Due to increased agression on their mining routes, it’s common for them to employ ex-military troops and battle mechs to defend their operations.</p>
