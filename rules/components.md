# Game Components

## Base Cards

These the the horizontal formatted cards that denote each of your 3 lanes, Attack, Mining and Tech. The number on the bottom of each card represents your *base power* in that lane. Most abilities and cards that effect a lanes power cannot reduce your power below this base amount.
